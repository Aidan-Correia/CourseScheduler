# CourseScheduler
Final project for my OOP course

Much of the architecture written by my professor Al Verbanac, most of the implementation done by me

NOTE: THIS IS PURELY A DEMONSTRATIONAL REPOSITORY, IT WAS MADE WITH APACHE NETBEANS AND IT IS QUITE A HASTLE TO SET UP THE DERBY DATABASE etc..

-this is simply meant to demonstrate the codebase, and my understanding of JDBC and SQL principles.

NOTE: Additionally, I designed the UI through the built-in NetBeans GUI designer, so the architecture/documentation in the MainFrame.java class is atrocious, I promise I do not typically write 500-line-long methods/constructors
